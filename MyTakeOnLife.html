<h2>My Take On Life</h2>
<p>There were many periods in my life when I had depression. Once I started to go with the flow, I became a more positive thinker. Go with the flow has become my motto. Whatever happens, happens for a reason. Because I am now a more positive person, I am able to spread my joy to other people and make at least part of their day better. 
<br><br>Some days can be a drag, but you have got to remember that other people have it worse and that there must be some way to make the day better.
<br><br>Since starting college, I have added onto my life views. I had decided that I should not care about what others think of me personally. Life is too short not to do the things that make you happy even if other people judge you for it. You do what makes you happy and mentally healthy.
