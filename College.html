<h2>College</h2>
<h3>Freshman/Sophomore Year</h3>
<p>
Because I went to Mass Academy for high school, I had some transfer credits when coming to Wentworth. Unfortunately, what Wentworth considers a Sophomore is someone with 32+ credits and I had 31 credits. For my first term, I was considered a freshman and for my second term, I was considered a Sophomore. 
<br><br>My experience with rooming was an interesting one. To start off, I had two roommates that we will call K and S. K, S, and myself got along. There was another room in the suite with A, N, and M. In the other room, there was an issue between M and the two other roommates. Because I was friends with A and N, I suggested with M to switch rooms so she could feel more comfortable, which is what ended up happening. Everything was good until the week of both my and another girl in the friend group’s birthday. The friend group threw a relatively large celebration for the other girl on Friday. Saturday was supposed to be the day my friends and I would go out for my birthday because my birthday was on a Monday. At 1 AM on Saturday, all of my friends except my boyfriend, bailed out of the plans we had for a couple of days. Not only did they not say happy birthday until 7 PM and give the leftover cupcakes from the other girl’s birthday, but I found out that they decided to manipulated my boyfriend to get back at him for being rude the past couple of days instead of talking to him like adults. For months, I was scared out of my room because they wouldn’t talk to me, made posts to try to antagonize me and my boyfriend, and talked bad about me and my boyfriend the entire time. I would only go to my room for showers and to get clean clothes. Before switching my room, I asked to have an in person conversation with them. They swore me out saying how I am being petty and I should just text it or drop it. The conversation I wanted to have with them was about having my boyfriend in the room which they banned him from to help me quickly move out. So I went to the RA, RD, and assistant of residential life until I got my meeting. In the meeting, they suggested I kept bringing up drama, made posts about them, didn’t try to be friendly to them, and should move all of my belongings from the room I was still paying for into my boyfriend’s ad his roommate’s double. The conversation was ridiculous because they tried painting themselves as the victims. It was later decided that I had to plan my move out around my ex-roommates while that sat there and watched me and my boyfriend move me out because they were afraid that we would steal their belongings. They didn’t even often to help, they just sat there and watched. I am glad I moved out though. I am so much happier in my new room and the entire event taught me how to deal with difficult situations. In the end, I came out of the term being on the dean’s list and dealt with intense personal situations all while they both drop and/or failed 3 classes each.
<br><br>Currently, I am in a better place most literally. I moved out of that suite and into another, but this time I have a single. The girls here seem really nice and I have yet to have a major issue. I personally will not pursue them due to my past history with girls and them backing stabbing me. But I wouldn’t mind saying yes if they asked me to hang out.
