<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Gia, or G, whichever you prefer. 
I have spent my entire life living in Hubbardston, MA
 (yes, it does exist; google it). I am of Asian and 
 American descent, which causes some people to stare at 
 both my sister and I. I ended up writing <a href = pics/MixedChildEssay.pdf>my college essay</a>
  on the experiences of being a mixed child growing up.
<br><br>Despite going to a math and science school for both
 my last two years of high school and college, I enjoy
  the arts (it’s like I’m a Renaissance [wo]man). I enjoy
   singing, 
   <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0UhV5m5AkXIR1oyWEljazZqbms" target="_blank">acting</a>, painting, and <a href="photography">photography</a>. I am obsessed 
   with makeup, fashion, and hair. 
<br><br>Feel free to explore my website!
<br><br>I want this whole thing to be a positive experience for everyone. Please contact me through any of my social media or email me if you have questions, concerns, or any sort of comment. This is a judgement free zone and I want it to be a safe place for everyone.
