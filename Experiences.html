<h2>Experiences</h2>
<h3>Work Experiences</h3>
<p>I work at the extended day program; so a lot of kids know me. I enjoy working with kids, despite the occasional “bad day.” I have also worked as a ski instructor at Wachusett Mountain, but now I am back at ski school desk because I like to not have my shins bruised by kids flying down a slope.
</p>

<h3>Childhood</h3>
<p>Everyone has a different childhood. I can bet you not one person has the same exact childhood. 
<br><br>Moving on, the first thing I can really remember is my daycare. As a child, I was taught to listen to anyone older than me which is exactly what I used to do. However, the daycare owner's son would soon take advantage of that and lead to me learning bad habits. For the most part, I was a good child with the occasional throwing a spoon at someone for who knows what reason. The owner's son would tell me to for example scratch my leg and have me tell his mom that he hurt me. I'm like 4ish at this point and did not think ahead to what would happen if I did that. Granted, my dad would be informed that I lied about her son hurting me. He would spank me at home until I admitted what I did. Well, little did the grownups in my life know that the son is a pathological liar. Occasionally I would have to lie about what I apparently did. I eventually figured out that lying would get me out of a long punishment. Because lying became a terrible habit at a very young age, it took me a long time to learn how to stop lying to get out of trouble. 
<br><br>The next thing I remember is preschool. In preschool I was for the most part happy except there was this one girl would would constantly tease me. But for the majority of my time there, I would ignore her. It's weird thinking back to my preschool because it was religious and my entire family is not religious in any sort of way. We would thank God for our lunch every single day and learn religious songs. I'm fairly certain I thought I met the guy I wanted to marry. His name was Gabe and we planned a whole wedding. Sadly, he moved away and we lost touch. Guess it wasn't meant to be.
<br><br>During the preschool years, I developed a fear of balloons wrapping around my neck and killing me and also a fear of swings. The balloon thing is irrational. I know it would take a lot and I mean A LOT of balloons in order for them to actually strangle me, but it's still a legit fear. The swing fear started after I watched a kid hurt himself after jumping off one. Also, what if the swings next to each other tangle? A disaster would happen!
<br><br>Occasionally, during the school year, the staff would create a mind challenge. There was one with carpets and crossing the gym. Younger me realized there was one more carpet than there were of us, so I suggested going as far as we can and picking up the last one and passing it forward. To this day, the staff of the preschool tell my dad that I was the only would able to figure that out. 
<br><br>During the summer of preschool, my dad and I would spend a lot of time because he was a teacher and had the summer off. I am definitely a daddy's girl. We would go to my aunt's school to play on the playground, go on bike rides, and go swimming at my dad's coworker’s private beach at a pond. I had a fantastic imagination as a child because I could entertain myself for hours with the assistance of toys from my aunt. 
<br><br>One summer, my dad and mom took the three of us to Cancun. I remember doing a bunch of crafts, learning how to swim, and becoming addicted to piña coladas due to my mom letting me sip one of hers. Something bad that happened was that I got rather big piece of glass stuck in my foot. Something funny as a small child that doesn't know better is that I out dead baby jellyfish on my mom's back when pretending her back for a grill for my weird gooey-sand hamburgers. I also faked snorkeling because I couldn't figure it out. I still don't know how to to this day. 
<br><br>My aunt was a big part of my childhood too. Although I thought she was scary when I was extremely young, I came to love her like a second mom. We saw each other at least once a month and because of this, her spare room was labeled as my room. Every time I would go over, there would be something fun on the bed. When I was older, I would see her a lot more and came to learn all of her favorite things and even her coffee order. We once flipped over in her car on the way to Polar Express. I can't help but think of her when I watch the Polar Express. Now we both share the fear of driving in snowy/icy weather and getting in a car accident. She was the reason I got to see a lot of movies when growing up. My parents would only take us out to movies once a year. But my aunt would take me and my sister out as an excuse to see kids movies. My sister and I grew up on my aunt hosting holiday parties for Easter, St. Patrick's Day, and Halloween. Those were my favorite because my aunt gave us all a way to visit with the family that lives further away. She has done so many good things for me and my sister; she deserves the world. 
<br><br>I haven't talked much about my mom, so let me say some things about her. My mom is Chinese-Cambodian. My most memorable childhood moment with her was after our addition was finished, she was working in the interior. Our addition has an extremely high ceiling. Like my balloons would accidentally float up there and no one could reach it until the helium started to escape. I would occasionally throw up a fun size butterfinger to her. To a 5 or 6 year old, this was extremely fun to try to aim.

<h3>Not So Good *Trigger Warning*</h3>
<p>
I have been raped. Parts of my story were written all over the news because it happened at a school. This story forced me to accept and be more open about what had happened to me. This is something that is not going to go away. I even got a tattoo. 
</p>
<img alt="Tattoo of Moon and Lotus" src="pics/tat.jpg" style="width: 50%; margin: auto; display: table">
<p>
The tattoo is of a moon and a lotus. The moon is for all of the change my family and myself have gone through since I revealed to them about what happened. A lotus starts from the mud, grows out from the mud onto the surface of a body of water, and becomes a beautiful thing. So from all of the changes that have happened in my family, hopefully something good will come out of this mess. But this entire experience has taught me that not everyone is as they seem. I still give people the benefit of the doubt, but I am more cautious Because I am have been raped and I am open about it, it does not mean that I am broken. Despite all that has happened, I am still growing through life as best as I can and I will not stop pushing forward.

<p>
I did not go to a normal high school for my last two years of high school. I attended Quabbin Regional School District until the end of my sophomore year of high school. Sophomore year, I applied to Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science at WPI. I almost wasn’t able to apply because my guidance counselor waited until the last day to write my needed recommendation letter from a guidance counselor. It is clear that I got in. Junior was sort of difficult, but also a relief. Junior year brought me to a group of accepting people which allowed me to open up more to people. In Junior year, I was a part of many projects. 
<br><br>One project I took part of is my STEM project. I looked into the connection between three different styles of music to memorizing. It was difficult to find at least thirty people over the age of 18 to help volunteer to do test for my project. In case you’re curious, the results were inconclusive.
<br><br>Another project I took part in was an adaptive watering can. This project was done in a group. Our group made a watering can that attached to a wheelchair on a pole with a clamp. The pole holds up the pouch containing the water. The pouch has a tube which leads to a handle that uses minimal amount of pressure to open the nozzle that deploys the water. Our group had the most difficulty with designing and 3D printing a clamp that would not slide down the side of the wheelchair.
<br><br>A project I am pretty proud of is an app I created with a group. The app is designed to mimic a social media app whilst combining a classroom aspect. The main purpose of the app was to allow teachers to post homework assignments and for students to easily view the incoming assignments. The app uses a twitter API. I helped design the GUI of the app, from the color scheme to all of the buttons present on the app.
<br><br>The final project of Junior year was a movie for Spanish. I am definitely not expert in Spanish. Although, I can say “no me gusta hablando en espanol” fairly well. This was one of the most difficult projects I did that year. I wasn’t allowed to use English and there were some group issues. You can view the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikSzdk_tMjg&index=5&list=PL85UikdLa5y1VCoK7XSL_DdNHSIzmTmn6" target="_blank">here</a>. There were some technical problems, so the video is not the best.
<br><br>Senior year was actually my Freshman year at WPI. I took all WPI classes for the entire year. By attending a college for an entire year, it has definitely helped me navigate college before going away for college. I decided not to go to WPI because I felt like it would be like high school for three more years. The end of Senior year, I was dealing something very difficult in my life so my GPA was subpar. But I am thankful for what I have gone through because if it didn’t happen, I might not be where I am today.
