<h2>What I Do</h2>
<p>
People tend to see me as the type of person who does not like coding, but I mean, this is my fourth time redesigning my website for fun. Coding has set rules, much like math. There aren’t that many interpretations for each question in CS, unlike English. What attracts me to CS is its predictability. Unless you code in secret links to certain things *HINT HINT*.
<br><br>On the other hand, art does not have set rules. This allows viewers to see things the way the artist sees things. When I was a quieter person, art allowed me to express myself. As I become more of an outgoing person, art continues to allow me to express myself, but I rely on it less as my primary way of expression. So I have a lot of art projects ranging from poetry to photography to doodles to my own hair. 
<br><br>I know enough American Sign Language to be able to withhold a conversation. I absolutely enjoy ASL because it’s almost like acting without speaking. I am currently adding onto my vocabulary for sign language.
