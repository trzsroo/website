<h2>Poems</h2>

<h3>Toxic</h3>
<p>
Chartreuse pus oozes<br>
from all openings of their bodies.<br>
Their discharge disguises<br>
them as pleasurable. Only a select few<br>
can see their true nature<br><br>

Behind the gushing purulence, their skin is starting<br>
to decay from all of the impurities they spread<br>
Their hair is matted and falling out in greasy yet dry clumps<br><br>

Enchantment of the pus is so strong <br>
that not even they can comprehend<br>
the insalubrity of their existence<br><br>

Breaking free from their tight clutch<br>
is a feat. But your name<br>
will linger on <br>
the tips of their tongues<br>
as they paint you<br>
as toxic<br><br>

一G.L. Hill<br><br><br>

<h3>His Kiss</h3>
<p>
Most pieces of literature describe kisses<br>
as magical things<br>
as if they are buff knights in just polished<br>
armor riding a unicorn with a silky, golden <br>
mane as rainbows comes from its hooves, <br>
emerging from the dense fog to embrace <br>
a virgin girl and become her savior.  <br><br>

I've been puked on,<br>
I've had children spit on me,<br>
I've accidentally created a gash that<br>
didn’t stop bleeding for over a week.<br><br>

I much rather do any of those<br>
things again than have<br>
to kiss his slobbery,<br>
spit-infested, chapped-lipped,<br>
food hole.<br><br>

I’ve dealt with the pecker,<br>
the slobberer, the doesn’t-<br>
know-what-they’re-doing, the <br>
is-this-your-mouth, the <br>
what-do-you-do-with-your-tongue,<br>
and the eyes-wide-open;<br>
Each I was able to help improve,<br>
But his…<br>
There was no way to fix it.<br><br>

When he kissed me, his breath<br>
was as foul as the smell<br>
of rotting seaweed in the fall at a harbor.<br><br>

Once, we tried French kissing.<br>
I felt like a Tootsie lollipop<br>
and he was trying to see how<br>
many licks it took<br>
to get to the center of me.<br><br>

He would buy his lovers<br>
clothes, jewelry, and food<br>
to make them like him,<br>
but not enough money<br>
would be able to fix<br>
him and me or his kiss.<br><br>

It’s all in the past now, but<br>
I feel bad for the forlorn soul<br>
that has the absolute misery<br>
to face battle with who I thought<br>
was my knight.<br><br>

<h3>Did the Bee</h3>
<p>
Did the bee ask before he pollinated the flower?<br>
Her soundless slumber did not invite him in,<br>
Yet not for a moment did he think that he should stop.<br><br>

Did the bee think about how he affected the flower?<br>
The flower’s thoughts are filled with what she could’ve done.<br>
Her petals curl in tight while he continues to pollinate other flowers.<br><br>

Did the bee ever regret what he has done to the flower?<br>
The flower has to live with the internal pain every day,<br>
But no one knows what the bee has actually done to her.<br><br>

<h3>Out of Order</h3>
<p>
out of order<br>
am i not working<br>
or am i in the wrong place<br>
wrong place, wrong time<br>
always out of order<br><br>
一G.L. Hill<br><br><br>
</p>

<h3>Gone</h3>
<p>
hold my hand<br>
pull me close<br>
make me forget it all<br>
let me adore you<br>
trace my fingertips over your skin<br>
kiss those lips that fit so well with mine<br>
let’s disappear together<br><br>
一G.L. Hill<br><br><br>
</p>

<h3>Obsession</h3>
<p>
their smile,<br>
their hair,<br>
their touch…<br>
an obsession turned addiction<br><br>
一G.L. Hill<br><br><br>
</p>

<h3>Broken Heart</h3>
<p>
all of this hurt<br>
for a heart<br>
that never loved you<br>
like you loved them<br><br>
一G.L. Hill<br><br><br>
</p>

<h3>Her</h3>
<p>
resist. <br>
i want to touch her, <br>
to hold her, <br>
to kiss her, <br>
but i can’t. <br>
what if i hurt her, <br>
break her,<br>
leave her wanting more. <br><br>
一G.L. Hill<br><br><br>
